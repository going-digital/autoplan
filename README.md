Assemble relevant planning documentation for Lowestoft town council

This script compiles planning information for the use of parish councillors involved in planning consultation. Although intended for Lowestoft Town council, it should be modifiable for use by any parish in East Suffolk.

This script uses data from the following resources:

* [East Suffolk Council Planning Portal](https://publicaccess.eastsuffolk.gov.uk/online-applications/)
* [Google Maps](https://www.google.co.uk/maps)

This script is by Peter Knight, and has not as yet been adopted for formal use by any council.
