Assemble relevant planning documentation for Lowestoft town council

The agenda of the Lowestoft Town Council planning committee is frequently packed. As one of the biggest and busiest parish/town councils in the country, there is a strong desire to reach accurate planning determinations with minimum delay whilst making best use of councillors time.

With this in mind, the aim of this project is to pull together planning notes automatically, so all documents and evidence is to hand for the meeting.

As the planning portal for Lowestoft Town Council is also shared with all the parish and town councils in East Suffolk, UK, this system should ultimately be usable by them too.

The intention is to automate the following:

* Generating lists of all planning applications that require determination.
* Generating links for each application to public mapping APIs, so local maps and photography are accessible.
  * Google Maps and Streetview.
  * Bing.
  * Openstreetmap.
* Caching and updating documents to better handle unreliable document servers.
* Grouping together related applications.
* Highlighting relevant prior decisions, reapplications.
* Generating reports for councillors and for the planning meeting.
